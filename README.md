## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents the implementation and comparative analysis of two Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms: **Prim's Algorithm** and **Kruskal's Algorithm**. Both algorithms were implemented in Java and tested on 30 different graph datasets ranging from 5 to 3000 vertices.

**Key Findings:**
- Both algorithms consistently produce the same MST total cost (correctness verified)
- Kruskal's algorithm performs better on sparse graphs (fewer edges)
- Prim's algorithm performs better on dense graphs (many edges)
- Operation counts correlate with theoretical time complexities
- Execution time increases predictably with graph size

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Problem Statement

The city administration needs to construct roads connecting all districts while minimizing total construction costs. This problem is modeled as finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph where:

- **Vertices** represent city districts
- **Edges** represent potential roads
- **Edge weights** represent construction costs

### 2.2 Objectives

1. Implement Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for MST computation
2. Measure and compare algorithm performance metrics
3. Analyze efficiency differences across various graph sizes and densities
4. Determine optimal algorithm selection criteria

### 2.3 Methodology

**Implementation Approach:**
- Language: Java 17
- Data structures: Priority Queue (Prim's), Union-Find (Kruskal's)
- Input format: JSON files with graph specifications
- Output format: JSON files with MST results and metrics

**Testing Strategy:**
- Small graphs (5-30 vertices): Correctness verification
- Medium graphs (50-300 vertices): Performance observation
- Large graphs (350-1000 vertices): Scalability testing
- Extra-large graphs (1500-3000 vertices): Stress testing

## 3. Algorithm Implementations

### 3.1 Prim's Algorithm

**Approach:** Greedy algorithm that grows MST from a starting vertex by always selecting the minimum weight edge connecting a visited vertex to an unvisited vertex.

**Key Implementation Details:**
```
1. Initialize: Start from arbitrary vertex, mark as visited
2. Add all edges from starting vertex to priority queue
3. Repeat until all vertices visited:
   a. Extract minimum weight edge from priority queue
   b. If destination vertex unvisited:
      - Add edge to MST
      - Mark destination as visited
      - Add all edges from new vertex to priority queue
4. Return MST edges and total cost
```

**Data Structures Used:**
- **Priority Queue:** O(log E) insertion and extraction
- **Hash Set:** O(1) visited vertex checking
- **Adjacency List:** O(1) neighbor lookup

**Time Complexity:** O(E log V) with binary heap priority queue

**Space Complexity:** O(V + E) for adjacency list and visited set

**Operation Counting:**
- Edge insertions into priority queue
- Priority queue comparisons
- Visited checks
- Neighbor iterations

### 3.2 Kruskal's Algorithm

**Approach:** Greedy algorithm that sorts all edges by weight and adds them to MST if they don't create a cycle, using Union-Find for cycle detection.

**Key Implementation Details:**
```
1. Sort all edges by weight (ascending)
2. Initialize Union-Find with each vertex in separate set
3. For each edge in sorted order:
   a. Check if endpoints in different sets (no cycle)
   b. If different:
      - Add edge to MST
      - Union the two sets
   c. Stop when MST has V-1 edges
4. Return MST edges and total cost
```

**Data Structures Used:**
- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set):**
    - Path compression: Nearly O(1) find operations
    - Union by rank: Balanced tree structure
- **Edge sorting:** O(E log E)

**Time Complexity:** O(E log E) dominated by sorting

**Space Complexity:** O(V) for Union-Find structures

**Operation Counting:**
- Sorting comparisons
- Union-Find operations (find and union)
- Edge processing iterations

3. **Testing Expansion:**
    - Add weighted graph generators with specific patterns
    - Test with real-world network data
    - Stress testing with graphs >5000 vertices
    - Edge case testing (disconnected graphs, single vertex)

4. **Performance Optimization:**

### 7.6 Final Remarks

This project successfully demonstrates the implementation and analysis of two fundamental MST algorithms. The comprehensive testing on 30 diverse datasets provides strong empirical evidence supporting the theoretical complexity analysis.

**Key Takeaway:** While both Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms guarantee finding the minimum spanning tree, the choice between them should be guided by graph characteristics (density) and implementation constraints (data structures available). For typical city transportation networks with moderate to high connectivity, **Prim's algorithm is generally the better choice**, as confirmed by our empirical results on larger, denser graphs.

The implementation demonstrates professional software engineering practices with proper encapsulation, clean architecture, and comprehensive testing, making it suitable for real-world applications in network optimization problems.
